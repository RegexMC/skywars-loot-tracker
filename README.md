# Skywars Loot Tracker

</div>

*Currently does not limit to skywars and will track all chests*

*Opening the same chest twice will cause it to log the items twice.*

## Usage
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/RegexMC/skywars-loot-tracker/releases)  and add the mod to your mods folder.

Once in game, it will begin automatically tracking all your loot from each chest you open and saving it to `.minecraft/skywarsloottracker/output.json`.

To toggle it on or off, run `/skywarsloottracker toggle`, and to export the data to a CSV, run `/skywarsloottracker exeport`.

**Please note that if you run out of space on your drive while using this mod it may wipe the output file.**
